Hold a straight edge tool parallel to the tire to help you notice if there is any bend in the wheel. The vehicle may need to be in nuetral depending on which wheel you are checking, if the wheel is not spining freely you will want to put the vehicle in nuetral, make sure you use chop blocks to keep the vehicle from sliding.']"
"Feel - I feel it (i.e. hesitation, shimmy, vibration, or a pull)",Vibration - Vehicle shakes. Ususally felt in the steering wheel or the seat,When do you feel the vibration?,Constantly when traveling at higher speeds,Front Wheels Out of Balance (Wheel Weight Fell Off),"Wheel balance can affect the ride of your vehicle, if the wheels are out of balance you may be experiencing a vibration feeling or vibration noise when driving, and sometimes its even stronger at highway speeds. Wheel balancing is done to compensate for heavy spots of  the wheel and tire, if your wheels are bent or chipped this can cause your wheel to be out of balance. Wheel weights are adhered or clipped to the wheel rim to compensate for these differences. Irregular tire wear is also a symptom of a wheel not being balanced.","1) Secure the vehicle on a level surface, making sure the vehicle will not roll or lean when jacked up.', ""2) Use a floor jack to lift the vehicle. Most vehicles are equipped with a factory floor jack commonly located in the trunk. To properly use the floor jack consult your vehicle owner's manual. Following the owner's manual instructions will give the correct location to jack the vehicle up and the the proper operation of the jack.  3) Secure the vehicle with jack stands on both sides for added safety before starting any work. Do not rely on the floor jack tosupport the entire weight of the vehicle. 4) Now remove the lug nuts followed by the wheels. 5) After removing the wheel/tire from the vehicle, it will be necessary to take it to a certified automotive repair faciltiy to complete the tire/wheel balance inspection. Otherwise, if you have direct access to tire/wheel balancing equipment, follow the manufacturers instructions to complete the process. 6) Balancing the tire/wheel assemblyinvolves the precise placement of wheel weights on opposite sides of the inner or outer edge. The weights arespecifically designed for different rim/wheel applications. If performing this procedure on your own, pay close attention to the typeof wheel weights necessaryand make sure final readings reach optimum wheel/rim balance. 7) After the wheel/rim is balanced, check the rim/wheel for possible damage. In some cases, the wheel/rim may be bent or cracked beyond repair, causing the steering wheel to pulsate and experience rough road drivability. If this issue is present, it will be necessary to replace the entire rim/wheel assembly. 8) Also, check the tires for proper tread. Uneven tire tread wear is an indication that the problem may have to befurther diagnosed into the vehicle suspension. Tires can be just as responsible for uneven balance, if they look bald, have side wall damage or are under inflated.']"

It is a good idea to ask the technicians to check your wheel torque by hand whenever you have work done to your vehicle.","1) Wheel Lug nuts are responsible for holding your wheels to the vehicle. On some vehicles the lugs nuts are exposed and easy to get to. Some wheels may have a hub cap or center rim cap that cover the lug nuts, Using a flat head pop off the hub cap or rim center cap. 2) The wheel lug nuts should be tight on the wheel and the wheel should be flat against the hub. Make sure all the lug nuts are accounted for, and for obvious damage. Check the lug nuts by trying to turn them by hand if you are able to twist any of them at all then the lug nuts are loose and you will want to further inspect to find out why the lug nuts are loose, and make the necessary repairs.

Some after market manufacturers sell the frame and mirror assembly, otherwise you may need to remove the glass from the frame which can be a more involved process, it is probably easier to replace the entiremirror assemblyif that is the case. 2) Inspect the operation of the power mirror, if the mirror is moving but not in a specific direction then there is a problem with the internal motor operating the direction of the mirror. If only one of the power mirrors is not working then the problem is in the mirror is that not working most likely the motor has failed. If both power mirrors have failed try the fuse.']"
