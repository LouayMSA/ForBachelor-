If a thermostat is stuck open the vehicles engine will not reach its optimal running temperature and over time this can cause engine sludge build up, a common problem associated with an open thermostat is the heating system not getting hot enough.","2) If the vehicle is hot allow it to cool before performing this test, if the vehicle is all ready cool start the vehicle. Using an infrared thermometer check the temperature at the upper and lower radiator hose. If you do not have an infrared thermometer you can use your hands to test the temperature of the hoses, make sure to be careful of the moving parts of the engine. After several minutes the hoses should begin to get hot, take note of the upper radiator hose. This hose should all at once begin to warm up letting you know the thermostat has opened and the hot coolant is going from the engine to the radiator to be cooled. If several minutes pass and the hose does not get hot, check the engine temperature inside the vehicle if it is climbing and beginning to over heat shut the vehicle down, the problem is the thermostat is stuck closed.",Stuck Thermostat

First is the coolant system keeps the engine from getting to hot and breaking down. The coolant is pushed via the vehicles water pump through coolant ducts in the engine to keep the operating temerature consistent. The other function is for colder climates, during the cold winter months the temperature can fall well below freezing, the coolant/antifreeze has to stay in a liquid state, if there was only water in the system the water would freeze and expand causing damage to the engine.","1) Open the Vehicles hood and locate the radiator cap and/or coolant reservoir.

There are many different types of headlights: incandescent, halogen, and xenon. Incandescent headlights work the same as any light in your home and use a resistor filament to produce light that can break over time. If you have halogen lights It is important when replacing them that you not touch the glass part of the light bulb, because the oils from your skin can actually shorten the life expectancy. Xenon headlights or HID headlights are gas charged bulbs that emit a more intense light; these bulbs are more expensive and last longer.","7) If power is not recieved, the problem may at the switch, wiring or at the connector which will require further inspection.
