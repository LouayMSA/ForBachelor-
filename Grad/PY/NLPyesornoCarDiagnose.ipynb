      "Description:  ['Engine mounts are subject to normal wear; however, excessive torque and movement between the engine block and frame can prematurely weaken them. If one engine mount is bad, it is common for the other to be worn. Replacing both at the same time is strongly recommended.']\n",

      "Inspection List:  [\"1) Start the engine and locate the engine mounts. 2) Have an assistant in the vehicle, apply the parking brake, press the brake pedal with your left foot, shift the transmission into gear and lightly apply pressure onto the gas pedal. 3) When torque is applied to the engine while in gear, visually inspect the engine mounts. Look for excessive movement in the engine mounts and listen for a knocking noise when engine torque is released. Engine mounts are designed to absorb vibration during normal engine operation.Worn engine mounts will allow the engine to shift excessively creating vibration and noise.']\"]\n"
