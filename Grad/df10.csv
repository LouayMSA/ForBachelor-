Using plastic makes the vehicle lighter and more efficient. Plastic is easily broken and todays minor fender bender, can become costly. Plastic can not be easily repaired if it cracks, therefore even just one crack will mean the entire part needs to be replaced.","['1) Remove and clean any loose paint or dirt from the bumper’s damaged area.', '2) Visually inspect the damaged area to see how large the dent is. Look for any cracks, creases, or cuts in the plastic. \xa0If dents are too large to fix the bumper cover will need to be replaced. If the dent is through a style line or on a curve, the bumper cover will need to be replaced.', '3) Run your hands over the damaged area to see if you feel any dents or distortions on the bumper cover. Check for any obvious plastic damage before running your hands across the bumper cover. Always wear gloves for inspections, and be careful of sharp edges.', '4) Check the left and right sides of the bumper cover where it mounts to the body to see if it has broken loose.']"
Exterior Body,Front,"Located at Fascia (Front cover) (also includes absorber, reinforcement, License bracket,side supports, sensors, valance, spoiler)",Damaged Front bumper,Type Face bar type,Damaged Front Bumper,"Vehicle accidents are stressful and costly. There are many options to fixing body damage, and there are many lower cost options now available. Do some research before taking your vehicle in so you know if the part can be repaired or needs to be replaced, and if it needs to be replaced you may be able to find the part cheaper on your own and save yourself some cash.","['1) Locate the damaged area of the vehicle.', '2) Determine which part or parts of the vehicle are damaged. For example if your drivers side front fender is damaged,\xa0then also check for\xa0damage at the door either from being pushed into it, or from contact. Clean off any loose paint using a cloth or rag.', ""3) Visually inspect the damage, dents can be popped out and will most likely need to be painted. Scratches or scores that go into the metal, can be bondo'd; the process of using a polyester or fiberglass resin to fill a scratch or dent in a metal or plastic body part. However if the damage is\xa0excessive or the body part has become warped or distorted from\xa0the damage the best course of action is to replace the damaged body part. When it comes to large dents or scratches there is no rule of thumb; when deciding if the body part should be replaced or repaired things to consider are, the cost of the part vs repair of it, and time it would take to repair based on size of damage."", '4) For plastic body parts such as; valances, bumper covers, and spoilers, you will want to check for cracks. If the plastic is cracked then it will need to be replaced, for the most part cracked plastic is not easily repaired and it is\xa0best to replace the part.', '5) When the damage is beyond a simple patch and repair, you will need to check all the supports and brackets that hold that body part in place. These will need to be repaired or replaced also in order for the new body part to fit correctly.']"

Reasons for a windshield wiper motor malfunction could be, the gears of the motor have worn excessively or possibly broken, or electrical components or contacts within the motor have malfunctioned.","['1) A wiper motor can be located under the hood on the vehicles fire wall in the back of the engine compartment, or it can be located under the cowl which is the body part that that is in between the hood and windshield of the vehicle. If this is the case you will need to remove the wiper arms and the cowl to gain access to the wiper motor.', '2) For this inspection you will need a volt tester, and the vehicles wiper circuit wiring diagram.

Electrical Accessories,Wipers,When Turning on,Not working normally,Wipers are only working on certain speeds or not working on intermittent,Bad Windshield Wiper Switch,"A windshield wiper switch controls the power and speed of the windshield wipers. For some vehicles it is included in the multifunction switch in which the same switch can also have controls for the headlights, high beams, running lights, turn signals, and possibly the cruise control. Reasons for the windshield wiper switch or “multifunction switch” to go bad include, broken internal parts, regular wear, or overheating caused by a short or incorrect amperage to the switch.
